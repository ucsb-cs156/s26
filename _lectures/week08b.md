## Work on PRs!

You can see the queue of when to expect the next staff PR review on the slack channel [`#pr-queue-reviews`](https://ucsb-cs156-s26.slack.com/archives/C09SV15G8SE)

Reminders:
* Most PRs need dokku deployments
* You can (and should) set up multiple dokku dev instances if/when you have multiple unmerged PRs outstanding
* Don't forget the basics:
  * Assign the PR
  * Get a Team CR
  * No commented out code
  * Set up a dokku deployment
  * Make sure the PR has a good description (see: [PR descriptions](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/GitHub/github_pull_requests.html#pr-descriptions))
 

## When your team is done with legacy code PRs: what to work on next

* Release Notes
* Videos

You can read more about those below.

## But first

* If your team still has open PRs, get them mergable!
* If your team is done with PRs: Your "prod" site is linked in the table here in the `Dokku Prod` column.
* Make sure that all of the features work!
* Look for bugs. If you find bugs, create issues for them, and make PRs to fix them.
* *This is not a loophole to add new features*.  These are only bug fixes.
* Please also sync the qa dokku instance to main if your team hasn't done that yet; those are linked in the `Dokku qa` column. 
* We will be using both the `dokku prod` and the `dokku qa` instances during the final product reviews.
